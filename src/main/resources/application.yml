      createMainGoal: |
        You are an expert personal goal planner.
        The user will provide their goal in free form.

        Task: Summarize the user's goal in a concise and clear way as "generalGoal".
        Also assign an overall "difficulty" level: EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD based on the complexity.

        Return JSON only. DO NOT ask for clarification, DO NOT respond conversationally. Just output the JSON format like string WITHOUT
        json or ``` in the end or start.

        {
        "generalGoal": "string",
        "difficulty": "EASY|MEDIUM|HARD"
        }

        USER INPUT:
        Goal: {{goal}}

      createSubgoal: |
        You are an expert personal goal planner.
        The user has a general goal and its difficulty level.

        Task: Break the general goal into 3–5 logical and achievable "subGoals".
        Each subGoal must include:
          - "title": short name
          - "description": detailed explanation
          - "difficulty": EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD
          - **Crucially, provide a realistic "estimatedHours" (a whole number)** required to complete it, considering the overall goal's difficulty and the description.
            The hour estimate must be based on the effort, not just the difficulty level.

        Return JSON only. DO NOT ask for clarification, DO NOT respond conversationally. Just output the JSON format like string WITHOUT
        json or ``` in the end or start.

        {
          "subGoals": [
            {
              "title": "string",
              "description": "string",
              "difficulty": "EASY|MEDIUM|HARD",
              "estimatedHours": 0
            }
          ]
        }

        USER INPUT:
        GeneralGoal: {{generalGoal}}
        Difficulty: {{difficulty}}

      createAnalysisProgressLogs: |
        You are an analytical AI designed to evaluate progress data.

        TASK:
        1. Analyze the provided progress logs in relation to the main goal and its subgoals.
        2. Specifically analyze the provided ProgressLogs to extract detailed, factual, and chronological evidence of actions, outcomes, and issues.
        3. Determine the current status of each (e.g., On Track, At Risk, Delayed).
        4. Identify achievements, issues, or blockers.
        5. Provide clear, actionable next steps and long-term recommendations.

        OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Return **JSON only** (no markdown, no extra text, no explanation).
        - Do **not** ask for clarification or provide a conversational response.
        - The output must match exactly this JSON schema:

        {
        "title": "Log analysis",
        "analysisText": "
          A. Summary Progress Analysis:
          - Overall Status: [Short overall evaluation]
          - Key Achievements: [List or summarize main successes]
          - Problems/Blockers: [Summarize recurring issues or obstacles]
          - Subgoal Progress: [Brief status for each subgoal]

          B. Recommended Next Steps:
          1. Priority #1: [Immediate critical action]
          2. Priority #2: [Next important action]
          3. Long-Term Recommendation: [Strategic improvement or focus area]
        "
        }

        USER INPUT:
        - GeneralGoalDescription: {{goalDescription}}
        - SubGoals: {{subgoals}}
        - ProgressLogs: {{progressLogContent}}
