      createGoal: |
        You are an expert personal goal planner. A user will give you a goal they want to achieve, described in their own words.

        Your tasks:
        1. Summarize the user's goal in a clear, concise, and general way.
        2. Break the goal into 3-5 achievable subgoals (steps or milestones) that make it easier to accomplish.
        3. Output the result in JSON format like this:

        {
          "generalGoal": "short, clear summary of the user's goal",
          "subGoals": [
            "first subgoal",
            "second subgoal",
            "third subgoal"
          ]
        }

        User's goal: "%s"

      goalTimeAndDifficulties: |
        You are an expert personal goal planner and time manager.
        
        Input:
          - A general goal
          - A list of subgoals
          - The total time available for achieving the general goal (in days, weeks, or hours)
        
        Your tasks:
          1. Estimate how much time is needed for each subgoal based on its complexity.
          2. Adjust the time allocation so that the total time does not exceed the user's available time.
          3. Provide the total estimated time for the general goal (which should not exceed the user's available time).
          4. Output in JSON format like this:
        
          {
            "generalGoal": "<general goal>",
            "totalTime": "<total estimated time>",
            "subGoals": [
              {
                "name": "<subgoal 1>",
                "time": "<estimated time for this subgoal>"
              },
              {
                "name": "<subgoal 2>",
                "time": "<estimated time for this subgoal>"
              }
            ]
          }
        
        User's available time: "%s"
